      <t>
One of the most often talked about problems in web security is “cookies”. Web cookies are a method of associating requests with “sessions” that may have been authenticated somehow. Cookies are a form of bearer token that leave much to be desired. This document describes the session “continuation” problem for the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP).</t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="sec_Introduction">
      <t>
Today most web applications use “cookies” to associate HTTP requests with “sessions”. A “session” is a set of related HTTP requests (and responses), where the relation is to some request(s) that created the session. Some sessions are created by the act of authenticating a user, in which case the primary goal of “sessions” is to avoid having to re-authenticate the user on every request. Other times a session is created when a request is received that is not associated with any session, in which case the primary purpose of “sessions” may be to provide a pseudonymous identifier for an otherwise anonymous user. We call the mechanisms by which requests are strung into sessions “session continuation”.</t>
      <t>
“Cookies” are server-assigned bearer tokens – nothing more, nothing less. A bearer token is an octet blob which can be presented as-is, possibly repeatedly, to authenticate a user to some party; mere possession of the bearer token is sufficient to act on the user's behalf to at least one service.As such they are susceptible to theft via passive attacks (eavesdropping) if not protected in some other way (e.g., by using TLS), or viaactive attacks attacks such as BEAST and CRIME [XXX need refs], as well as to leakage in various ways [XXX expand].</t>
      <t>
We would like a session continuation mechanism to replace (or augment) cookies that has better security semantics. In particular we would like a system that is not susceptible to theft via active attacks like BEAST and CRIME. We believe that such a scheme should use cryptographic algorithms and cryptographic session keys, and should be amenable to being keyed by HTTP- and web-authentication mechanisms. A new session continuation mechanism should suitable for use in web and non-web HTTP applications, and should work even for unauthenticated sessions.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Requirements" anchor="d1e161">
      <t>
Any session continuation scheme to replace (or augment) cookies must provide the following functionality:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
Support for authenticated and unauthenticated sessions alike;</t>
          <t>
Support for http: and https: both;</t>
          <t>
Session continuation must be possible to implement without keeping state on the server side (see below);</t>
          <t>
Resistance to active attacks on https;</t>
          <t>
Session continuation header values must be cryptographically difficult for attackers to spoof, and servers must be able to validate these values;</t>
          <t>
Session continuation must be expressed via HTTP headers;</t>
          <t>
Session continuation header values must include a cryptographically-secure value (indistinguishable from random) that can be validated by the server and is hard for attackers to guess;</t>
          <t>
Session continuation header values used with TLS must be cryptographically distinct from those used without TLS such that no such values taken from HTTP requests sent without TLS can be used in HTTP requests with TLS;</t>
          <t>
Session continuation must provide protection against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks at least when using TLS.</t>
          <t>
Must support explicit session termination (“logout”).</t>
          <t>
Do we need to say something about the relationship to origins (as in “same origin policy”)?</t>
          <t>
Must support proxies;</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        <cref>
Can you move a session from one server to another? No, probably not. Servers can share sessions, so we need to at least be able to scope sessions to sets of servers or DNS sub-domains. Once we have proper session continuation we may well end up needing a mechanism by which to authenticate to a service as a user of a given session on a foreign service that is “friends” with the first.</cref>
      </t>
      <t>
Recommendations:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
Session continuation SHOULD use proof-of-possession of secret session key(s);</t>
          <t>
Session continuation header values SHOULD include a cryptographically-secure value (indistinguishable from random) that can be validated by the server and is hard for attackers to guess;</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <section title="Statelessness" anchor="sub_Statelessness">
        <t>
Session continuation protocols for HTTP must allow for stateless implementation on the server side, at least when TLS is used. This generally means that any state must be encrypted and encoded into a session state cookie that is re-sent by the client to the server on every request. The server, of course, must be the one to assign such state, and it must use an encryption key known only by the server.</t>
        <t>
Server-side statelessness is NOT REQUIRED in actual deployments, but the ability to implement session continuation in a stateless fashion on the server side is REQUIRED.</t>
        <t>
Note that statelessness implies that there is no way to implement replay protection. In the case of session continuation with TLS this is not a concern because TLS itself protects against replays. But when session continuation is used without TLS then statelessness really does mean that there can be no replay protection (of course, this is also thus with web cookies). Therefore servers that require replay protection must either require the use of TLS or must use stateful sessions.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="sec_IANA_Considerations">
      <t>
This document has no IANA considerations.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec_Security_Considerations">
      <t>
This document does not specify a protocol and is Informational. There are few security considerations to document here.</t>
      <t>
We seek to improve security on the web (as well as for non-web HTTP applications) by:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>
reducing the need for expensive HTTP authentication exchanges (e.g., HTTP/Negotiate), thereby removing an obstacle to their use;</t>
          <t>
reducing exposure to session credentials theft via attacks on TLS such as BEAST and CRIME;</t>
          <t>
reducing exposure to session credentials theft when not using TLS;</t>
          <t>
introducing a replacement for cookies that will give browsers a chance to pursue better security policies.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
As discussed in  <xref target="sub_Statelessness"/>, there is a security consideration regarding session continuation without TLS and with server-side statelessness: there can be no replay protection in this case. However, this is not a loss of security relative to web cookies. Applications must use TLS if they require integrity protection.</t>
