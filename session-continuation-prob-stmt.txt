   Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) Session Continuation: Problem
                               Statement
             draft-williams-websec-session-continue-prob-00

Abstract

   One of the most often talked about problems in web security is
   "cookies".  Web cookies are a method of associating requests with
   "sessions" that may have been authenticated somehow.  Cookies are a
   form of bearer token that leave much to be desired.  This document
   describes the session "continuation" problem for the HyperText
   Transport Protocol (HTTP).

Internet-Draft            HTTP Session Problem             December 2012


1.  Introduction

   Today most web applications use "cookies" to associate HTTP requests
   with "sessions".  A "session" is a set of related HTTP requests (and
   responses), where the relation is to some request(s) that created the
   session.  Some sessions are created by the act of authenticating a
   user.  Other times a session is created when a request is received
   that is not associated with any session.  We call the mechanisms by
   which requests are strung into sessions "session continuation".

   "Cookies" are server-assigned bearer tokens - nothing more, nothing
   less.  As such they are susceptible to theft in attacks such as BEAST
   and CRIME [XXX need refs], as well as to leakage in various ways [XXX
   expand].

   We would like a session continuation mechanism to replace cookies
   that has better security semantics.  In particular we would like a
   system that uses cryptographic algorithms and cryptographic session
   keys, and is amenable to being keyed by HTTP and web authentication
   mechanisms, is suitable for use in web and non-web HTTP applications,
   and can be keyed even for unauthenticated sessions.

2.  Requirements

   Any session continuation scheme to replace (or augment) cookies must
   provide the following functionality:

   1.  Support for authenticated and unauthenticated sessions alike;

   2.  Support for http: and https: both;

   3.  Session continuation must be possible to implement without
       keeping state on the server side (see below);

   4.  Session continuation must use proof-of-possession of secret
       session key(s);

   5.  Session continuation must be expressed via HTTP headers;

   6.  Session continuation header values must include a
       cryptographically-secure value (indistinguishable from random)
       that can be validated by the server and is hard for attackers to
       guess;

   7.  Session continuation header values used with TLS must be
       cryptographically distinct from those used without TLS such that
       no such values taken from HTTP requests sent without TLS can be
       used in HTTP requests with TLS;

   8.  Session continuation must provide protection against man-in-the-
       middle (MITM) attacks when using TLS.

2.1.  Statelessness

   Session continuation protocols for HTTP must allow for stateless
   implementation on the server side, at least when TLS is used.  This
   means that any state must be encrypted and encoded into a session
   state cookie that is resent by the client to the server on every
   request.  The server, of course, must be the one to assign such
   state, and it must use an encryption key known only by the server.

   Note that statelessness implies that there is no way to implement
   replay protection.  In the case of session continuation with TLS this
   is not a concern because TLS itself protects against replays.  But
   when session continuation is used without TLS then statelessness
   really does mean that there can be no replay protection (of course,
   this is also thus with web cookies).

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specify a protocol and is Informational.
   There are few security considerations to document here.

   We seek to improve security on the web (as well as for non-web HTTP
   applications) by:

   1.  reducing the need for expensive HTTP authentication exchanges
       (e.g., HTTP/Negotiate), thereby removing an obstacle to their
       use;

   2.  reduce exposure to credentials theft via attacks on TLS such as
       BEAST and CRIME;

   3.  introducing a replacement for cookies that will give browsers a
       chance to pursue better security policies.

   As discussed in Section 2.1, there is a security consideration
   regarding session continuation without TLS and with statelessness:
   there can be no replay protection in this case.  However, this is not
   a loss of security relative to web cookies.  Applications must use
   TLS if they require integrity protection.
